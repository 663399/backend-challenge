# Hello!

This is my version of the backend challenge. Being not too familiar with Python, I've used a Ruby framework called Sinatra (similar to Flask).

Here's a few steps to get it up and running:

1. Go to the the directory where config.ru is located.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Run `rackup`.
4. Access the app at `localhost:9292`.
5. Run `ruby app_test.rb` to run tests.

Thanks for taking the time to look through my code - looking forward to the feedback! :)
